## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/ev-sales-analysis.git

2.   **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd ev-sales-analysis

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage

To run the analysis:

Ensure the required packages are installed (see Installation).

**Run the main Python script for analysis:**
python analysis.py

**Alternatively, open the Jupyter Notebook for an interactive experience:**
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb

*The results will be displayed as visualizations (charts/graphs) and summary outputs.*



**Data**
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data for Electric Vehicles (EVs) from [Data Source]. The data includes the following columns:

**Year
Region
Sales Volume
EV Model
Price**

###Please download the data and place it in the data/ folder before running the analysis.

## Analysis

This project utilizes several Python libraries to analyze and visualize the EV sales data:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizations like line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.
Scikit-learn (if applicable): For any machine learning models used.


 **Key analyses performed include:**

Trend analysis of EV sales over the years.
Comparative analysis of sales in different regions.
Correlation analysis between EV sales and other variables like price and incentives.

## Visualizations
The following visualizations are generated during the analysis:

Line plots showing the growth of EV sales by region.
Bar charts comparing sales across different EV models.
Heatmaps visualizing correlations between different variables.
